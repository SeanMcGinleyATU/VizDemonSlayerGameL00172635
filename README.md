# Branching Strategy
The branching strategy I have chosen to use for this project is **GitHub Flow**, I chose this branching strategy because it was simple to understand and implement into my project. 
This strategy employs the use short lived feature branches that are then reviewed and merged into the main branch after which can be deleted to stop these feature branches cluttering up the repo leaving only the main branch.
